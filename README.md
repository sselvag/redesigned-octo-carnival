# Weather Dashboard
  
## As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. In this project, I need to create a Weather Dashboard that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When I search for a city, then I should be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
  2. When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I should be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
  3. When I view the UV index, then I should be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
  4. When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I should be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
  5. When I click on a city in the search history, then I should be presented with current and future conditions for that city again.
